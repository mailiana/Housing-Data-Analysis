# Housing-Data-Analysis

# 1. Objective
The purpose of this project is to analyze a housing dataset to:
● Determine the average, minimum, and maximum house prices
● Identify structural and feature-based patterns influencing pricing
● Explore the relationship between property area, number of bedrooms, and house pricing
● Support predictive insights and guide prescriptive strategies for pricing and development
focus

# 2. Project Overview
This project involved analyzing a dataset with 378 housing records across 13 variables using
Microsoft Excel. The variables include 6 numerical features (e.g., price, area, bedrooms) and 7
categorical features (e.g., basement, air conditioning, furnishing status). We performed
descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics using Excel techniques such as
PivotTables, formulas, charts, correlation, and regression.

# 3. Methodology
A. Data Cleaning
● Column Adjustments: Used auto-fit for better visibility (manual and VBA method).
● Filter Application: Enabled filters to inspect specific features like mainroad or
guestroom (none found).
● Duplicates: No duplicate records found.
● Blank Cells: Checked using filters and 'Go To Special' function; none found.
● Formatting: Bolded headers and froze the top row. Structured the dataset as a table for
analysis readiness.

# B. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
